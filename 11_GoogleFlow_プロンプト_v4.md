**尺**: 10秒

#### Frame A
```
A Japanese television screen showing an NHK news broadcast, early 2020s style. The red breaking news banner "速報" is just beginning to appear at the top of the screen. A professional news anchor desk is visible in the background with blue and white studio lighting. The screen has a subtle CRT television texture with faint scan lines, as if filmed from a living room TV. The image quality suggests it's being recorded through another screen. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

#### Frame B
```
A Japanese NHK television news broadcast in full breaking news mode. A prominent red "速報" (breaking news) banner spans the top of the screen. Below it, the main headline text "知床 観光船と連絡取れず" (Shiretoko tour boat contact lost) is clearly displayed in large white text on a dark blue background. A detailed map graphic of the Shiretoko Peninsula in Hokkaido appears on the right side of the screen, with the incident location marked.

A wide establishing shot inside the cramped office of a small Japanese tour boat company in Hokkaido. The space is cluttered and neglected: desks overflow with papers, boat schedules, and old documents. An old CRT television sits in the corner, currently showing a weather forecast. Harsh fluorescent tube lighting casts unflattering light from above. On the wall, a calendar clearly shows April 2022. Dirty windows with condensation offer a view of Utoro harbor outside. Ashtrays with cigarette butts and cold coffee cups sit on desks. Faded tour posters from previous seasons hang on the walls. The atmosphere suggests negligence and poor management. Documentary cinematography style, wide angle lens, ominous foreshadowing mood. 16:9 aspect ratio.

The same Japanese male office worker now on the phone, speaking casually. His back remains turned to the TV which clearly shows the "波浪注意報" weather warning behind him.

```

#### Frame B
```
Extreme digital zoom on Oshinkoshin Falls. The image has become severely pixelated and degraded from over-zooming, typical of smartphone maximum zoom.

Extreme digital zoom attempting to capture the bear. The image is severely pixelated, almost abstract. Very shaky excited footage as the tourist desperately tries to photograph the wildlife from the moving boat. Auto-focus hunts constantly, unable to lock on.

```

```

#### Frame B
```
The same man is now on the phone, and his expression has changed to one of concern. His brow is furrowed as he listens. A weather fax machine printout with wave warnings is visible on the desk. Through the dirty window, the harbor is visible. This is a warning call from another boat company - a warning that will be ignored. The ominous atmosphere of a decision that will cost 26 lives. Documentary style with slow zoom. 16:9 aspect ratio.
